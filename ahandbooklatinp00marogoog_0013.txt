pressiori), Orelli, Dillenburger (ed. 1860), and Rider, with
occasionn use os the older Gennan and English editions
of American editions none have been used except the ex-
cellent one ol Professor J. Ι. lincoln, to which reference
hasbeen made in all cases where matter has been drawn ,
directly from it. llis Lite of Horace and his Prolegorneua
are worthy of special commentlation ; and students wish-
ing to read more os Horace can hardly find a better edition
in compact form than that os Professor Lincoln.

In all cases, matter drawn from whatever source has
been carelully studied, condensed, and recast, when neces-
sary, to adopt it to our purposes. This has often exacted
tnore labor than wholly original matter would have done.

llotlr editors are responsible sor all parts of the work,

Ι all the matter having passed through the hands os both,

and the work ol each having been revised, corrected, and
modified by the other. The publication os thc book has
been delayed in part by this determination ol the editors
to go individually over all that they had written, and, as
sar as possible, to give unity and symmetry to the whole.

With this briei general statement ol the origin, plan,
character, and sources oi our work, we send it sorth in the
hope that it may meet the expectations of those who have
desired its publication, and may aid in awakening and pro
moting a livelier interest in classieal studies
